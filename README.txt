In current work we consider and implement several algorithms for
quantum state tomography, such that pseudo-inverse matrix, direct gradi-
ent algorithm, hedged likelihood method and semi-denite programming
methods. As testing model we develop procedure of numerical experiment
of measurement qubits in pure state.
